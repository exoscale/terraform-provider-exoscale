}
```

*Managed* EIPv6:

```terraform
resource "exoscale_elastic_ip" "my_managed_elastic_ip" {
  zone = "ch-gva-2"
  address_family = "inet6"
  reverse_dns = "example.net"

  healthcheck {
    mode         = "https"
    port         = 443
    uri          = "/health"
    interval     = 5
    timeout      = 3
