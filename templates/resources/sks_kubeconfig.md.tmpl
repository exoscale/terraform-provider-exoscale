# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manage Exoscale [Scalable Kubernetes Service (SKS)](https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/sks/) Credentials (*Kubeconfig*).

!> **WARNING:** This resource stores sensitive information in your Terraform state. Please be sure to correctly understand implications and how to mitigate potential risks before using it.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "exoscale_sks_cluster" "my_sks_cluster" {
  zone = "ch-gva-2"
  name = "my-sks-cluster"
}

resource "exoscale_sks_kubeconfig" "my_sks_kubeconfig" {
  cluster_id = exoscale_sks_cluster.my_sks_cluster.id
  zone       = exoscale_sks_cluster.my_sks_cluster.zone

  user   = "kubernetes-admin"
  groups = ["system:masters"]
}
```

Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/exoscale/terraform-provider-exoscale/tree/master/examples/)
directory for complete configuration examples.

## Automatic Renewal

This resource considers its instances to have been deleted after either their validity period ends or the early renewal period is reached. Past this period, applying the Terraform configuration will cause a new Kubeconfig to be generated.

Therefore in a development environment with frequent deployments, it may be convenient to set a relatively-short expiration time and use early renewal to automatically provision a new Kubeconfig when the current one is about to expire.

The creation of a new Kubeconfig may of course cause dependent resources to be updated or replaced, depending on the lifecycle rules applying to those resources.
