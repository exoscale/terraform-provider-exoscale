# exoscale_iam_org_policy (Resource)

Manage Exoscale [IAM](https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/) Org Policy.

-> IAM Organization Policy is persistent resource that can only be updated, thus terraform lifecycle is different: creation of resource updates the Org Policy and deleting resource only removes it from terraform state.

!> **WARNING** Org Policy applies to the whole organization including the account used by terraform.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "exoscale_iam_org_policy" "org_policy" {
  default_service_strategy = "allow"
  services = {
    sos = {
      type = "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/exoscale/terraform-provider-exoscale/tree/master/examples/)
directory for complete configuration examples.
