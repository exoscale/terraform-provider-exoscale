# exoscale\_elastic\_ip

Manage Exoscale [Elastic IPs (EIP)](https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/compute/eip/).

Corresponding data source: [exoscale_elastic_ip](../data-sources/elastic_ip.md).


### Usage

*Unmanaged* EIP:

```hcl
resource "exoscale_elastic_ip" "my_elastic_ip" {
  zone = "ch-gva-2"
}
```

*Managed* EIP:

```hcl
resource "exoscale_elastic_ip" "my_managed_elastic_ip" {
  zone = "ch-gva-2"

  healthcheck {
    mode         = "https"
    port         = 443
    uri          = "/health"
    interval     = 5
    timeout      = 3
    strikes_ok   = 2
    strikes_fail = 3
    tls_sni      = "example.net"
  }
}
```

Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/exoscale/terraform-provider-exoscale/tree/master/examples/)
directory for complete configuration examples.


## Arguments Reference

[zone]: https://www.exoscale.com/datacenters/

* `zone` - (Required) The Exoscale [Zone][zone] name.

* `description` - A free-form text describing the Elastic IP (EIP).

* `healthcheck` - (Block) Healthcheck configuration for *managed* EIPs. Structure is documented below.

### `healthcheck` block

* `mode` - (Required) The healthcheck mode (`tcp`, `http` or `https`; may only be set at creation time).
* `port` - (Required) The healthcheck target port (must be between `1` and `65535`).

* `interval` - The healthcheck interval (seconds; must be between `5` and `300`; default: `10`).
* `strikes_fail` - The number of failed healthcheck attempts before considering the target unhealthy (must be between `1` and `20`; default: `2`).
* `strikes_ok` - The number of successful healthcheck attempts before considering the target healthy (must be between `1` and `20`; default: `3`).
* `timeout` - The time before considering a healthcheck probing failed (seconds; must be between `2` and `60`; default: `3`).
* `tls_skip_verify` - Disable TLS certificate verification for healthcheck in `https` mode (boolean; default: `false`).
* `tls_sni` - The healthcheck server name to present with SNI in `https` mode.
* `uri` - The healthcheck target URI (required in `http(s)` modes).


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `ip_address` - The Elastic IP (EIP) IPv4 address.


## Import

An existing Elastic IP (EIP) may be imported by `<ID>@<zone>`:

```console
$ terraform import \
  exoscale_elastic_ip.my_elastic_ip \
  f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@ch-gva-2
```
