  Manage Exoscale Security Groups https://community.exoscale.com/product/compute/instances/quick-start/#firewall-rules---security-groups.
  Security Groups are firewall rules. Each Security Group may be attached to one or many compute instances.
  Individual firewall rules are configured using linked resource: exoscalesecuritygroup_rule ./security_group_rule.md.
  Corresponding data source: exoscalesecuritygroup ../data_sources/security_group.md.

# exoscale_security_group (Resource)

Manage Exoscale [Security Groups](https://community.exoscale.com/product/networking/security-group/).

Corresponding data source: [exoscale_security_group](../data-sources/security_group.md).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "exoscale_security_group" "my_security_group" {
  name = "my-security-group"
}
```

Next step is to attach [exoscale_security_group_rule](./security_group_rule.md)(s) to the group.

Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/exoscale/terraform-provider-exoscale/tree/master/examples/)
directory for complete configuration examples.
